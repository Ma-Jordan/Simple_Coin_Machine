# Simple_Coin_Machine
A simple coin machine which returns change to the user

This was my first coding assignment in C++. 

The program runs off a greedy algorithm in which the minimum amount of coins are returned.
The initial stock of coins are 25 nickels, 25 dimes, and 25 quarters.
A display is generated in the console to show the user how many coins remain and entering "q" will terminate the program.
During execution the user continually interacts with the console to make payments and make change. Appropriate messages will display once the change machine runs out.
The remaining stock left in the coin machine will display just before termination.
